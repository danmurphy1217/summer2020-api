        "description": "Lead Data Scientist, where I spent a majority of my time automating internal processes. The main internal processI automated was monthly report generation. Each month, our clients get a 13-page PDF that outlines the use of our product within their company. It usually took our CEO 3 hours to gather the data, create the plots, build the PDF, and send the report every month. With Python, Streamlit and an EC2 Micro instance from AWS, I automated the process of cleaning, gathering, and structuring the data, building the plots, and putting it all in a centralized place so that our CEO could compile and send the report in less than 20 minutes. Additionally, I built this (https://graph.joinjam.io/ubs-graph), a network graph that maps out all of the connections with our product within UBS. This was a tool that our CEO planned to raise around $1mm to develop. We ended up raising $0 and It took me under 3 weeks to build it completely in-house. It was built with R and shiny dashboard.",
